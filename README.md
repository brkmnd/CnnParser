# CnnParser : C-lang Neural Network Parser

- The project is decribed here https://brkmnd.com/pages/projects/Default.aspx?id=61
- run\_model.py runs the model, it can be trained, validated or tested
- complete\_me.py is a showcase of the parser. It suggests the next syntactical token.
- The parser is done in PyTorch. I can't remember how to detach things from cuda/gpu. So the parser will not run on systems without an nvidia gpu. I'll fix it at some point. Feel free to detach tensors and models yourself :-)
